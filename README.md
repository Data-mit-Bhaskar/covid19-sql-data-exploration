# **COVID-19 Data Exploration with Advanced SQL**
*A self-driven **Advanced SQL project** to deepen my expertise in **data analysis, joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregate functions**. This project aligns with my professional experience at **Sakon (GSG)**, where I optimized **ETL processes** and reduced data errors by **11%**, and my **MSc. Data Analytics** focus on transforming complex datasets into actionable insights.*

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project explores the **COVID-19 dataset** (from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)) using **Advanced SQL techniques** to uncover trends in **infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress**. I leveraged **joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, and views** to analyze global and continent-specific patterns, directly reflecting my **work at Sakon (GSG)**, where I used similar techniques to **clean, structure, and analyze large datasets** for business intelligence.

### **Key Achievements**
✅ **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Used **CTEs and temp tables** to preprocess and structure raw COVID-19 data.
✅ **Advanced SQL Queries**: Applied **window functions** to calculate rolling vaccinations and **aggregate functions** to derive infection/death rates.
✅ **Insightful Analysis**: Identified **high-risk countries, vaccination trends, and global death percentages**—skills I honed at **Mercedes-Benz** for time-series forecasting.
✅ **View Creation**: Built a **reusable SQL view** (`PercentPopulationVaccinated`) for future visualizations, mirroring my **database design** projects.

 |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
 | **SQL Server**           | Executed complex queries (joins, CTEs, window functions).                 | Used at **Sakon** for ETL automation.                  |
 | **CTEs & Temp Tables**   | Structured and cleaned data for analysis.                                | Aligns with my **data preprocessing** expertise.       |
 | **Window Functions**     | Calculated rolling vaccinations and infection rates.                     | Validates my **time-series analysis** skills.          |
 | **Aggregate Functions**  | Derived global/continent-specific metrics (e.g., death percentages).     | Reflects my **KPI-focused analytics** at Sakon.       |
 | **Views**                | Stored preprocessed data for reusable visualizations.                     | Matches my **database optimization** projects.         |
